# Software-Engineering-Project-
Handy Mail 

In this project we will create a google chrome extension that allows the user to compose emails through the gmail compose api with a single click on any page.

basic chrome extension building information https://developer.chrome.com/extensions/getstarted

basic html information https://www.w3schools.com/html/html_examples.asp

gmail api information https://developers.google.com/gmail/api/v1/reference/users/messages/send
I think this page and a few others about the gmail api will be very helpful.
