# Software-Engineering-Project-
Handy Mail 

In this project we will create a google chrome extension that allows the user to compose emails through the gmail compose api with a single click on any page.

basic chrome extension building information https://developer.chrome.com/extensions/getstarted

basic html information https://www.w3schools.com/html/html_examples.asp

gmail api information https://developers.google.com/gmail/api/v1/reference/users/messages/send
I think this page and a few others about the gmail api will be very helpful.

StackOverflow on how to actually send email via html: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/8239782/how-to-create-an-email-form-that-can-send-email-using-html

one other posibility would be to use the chrome app version instead of extension version.
https://developer.chrome.com/apps/app_codelab_basics

This is an example extension of what we are trying to do.
